## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I am already doing most of these. Yay! But I could do better with #4 (teach others) and #5 (take care of your brain). Specifically, I'd like to do more to seek out opportunities to help others, and I could/should/will make an effort to eat more vegetables at lunch. :) The big shift for me is going to be #6 (take short breaks, early and often). So far I have been horrible at taking short and frequent breaks. I tend to push myself too far and then collapse in a heap of exhaustion. But the evidence, and my own personal experience, suggests that I'll be better off if I stick to a schedule that includes plenty of breaks. Better take one now!


2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

*String*: a string of characters (letters, numbers, whatever). It's just a sequence of things. Often words or phrases but certainly doesn't need to be.

*Number*: a float or an integer. Integers are numbers like 2, 5, 879, and -13 (no decimals or fractions). A float is a decimal point number like 3.1415.

*Boolean*:  can have only one of two values: `true` or `false`. Example: `var isCatCute = true`.


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

`console.log("Hello World!")`


4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

For single-line comments, use two forward slashes, like so: `//this is a comment`. These single-line comments can start at the beginning of a line or in the middle of a line.

You can also have a comment run over one or more lines, like this:
```
/* Here is a multi-line comment
of the type you find in JavaScript. */
```


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a placeholder. It's a box you put things into. Some boxes can only fit certain kinds of things. For example, a Boolean variable/box can only have either `true` or `false` inside.


6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

One app I use a lot is my budgeting app. Here are some guesses at variables it might use and their datatypes:
* userName, a String
* accountBalance, a Number (float)
* isOverBudget, a Boolean


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation means adding things together. Adding strings or text together just means stringing them together, one after the other, like beads on a necklace.


8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

On the home screen where it greets the user. Probably something like ``"Hello, " + userName + "!"``


9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I am dying to know a keyboard shortcut or other efficient method for moving past the last character when Atom automatically creates a paired set of things. For example, if I type an opening double quotation mark, Atom will automatically create the matching closing quotation mark. Handy! But once I'm done adding my text between the quotation marks, I'll want to move past that closing quotation mark to type my semicolon. I can use the right-arrow key to do that, but it's inconvenient to reach for it with my pinky. Is there a more efficient way to do this?
