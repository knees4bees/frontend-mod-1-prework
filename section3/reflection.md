## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I'd like to keep in mind that having a growth mindset leads to more learning-oriented behaviors, and that people with a growth mindset are more likely to seek out a challenge.


1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I am always up for learning something new and understand that practice and effort don't always yield visible results immediately, but they do build on each other. I could do better at understanding that mistakes are not just useful, they're essential. Learning is shallow without mistakes to learn from.


1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

In the Amazon app, the items in my wishlist are probably stored as an array.


1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is a tool that operates on an array to change the array or gather information about the array.


1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop lets you reuse a chunk of code multiple times without rewriting it multiple times, and you don't necessarily need to know ahead of time how many times you will use it. A loop is useful in combination with an array when you want to do a thing to each element in an array.


1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

I would explain that a loop is like our daily routine. On the first day we wake up, get dressed, eat breakfast, play, nap, ..., and end with going to bed. Then it's a new day, and we've moved to the next day on the calendar (the next go-round in the loop) and we repeat the sequence of activities. We do this for as many days as our loop is long. For example, we might have a "weekday" loop that is five days long.


1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I'm wondering if there's a data structure that's like an array but is two-dimensional, so it's not just a list but a grid (in math it would be called a matrix). I guess I could google that to find out ... and cool, there is such a thing, but it's not built in to JavaScript. I'd need to make an array of arrays. Neat.
